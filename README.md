[00:12.18] Mass に合わせた lifestyle 無理でも楽すりゃ不利
[00:15.15] Freedom 謳歌 理不尽吹き飛ばす skill これ違う last minute
[00:18.70] Merci, au revoir
[00:19.86] Pride は邪魔する猛者, donc vas-y jete ca
[00:22.35] 全て tryし困憊, 笛に救われ halftime
[00:34.85] 
[00:40.17] Climax 夢見 all in
[00:41.94] オッズ見えない blurred
[00:43.82] 気持ち飛び立つ Boeing
[00:45.58] 一寸先はさぁ？
[00:49.08] 
[01:01.42] Kept walking on the wild side
[01:04.98] I don't wanna fall asleep throughout my life
[01:08.59] Sometimes in a Clyde Barrow style
[01:12.18] Sometimes like a James Bond mind
[01:15.61] Be wild side, try it
[01:15.99] Censor されるかも if I keep singing, keep rapping, keep telling the truth like Malcom X
[01:19.53] 死んでも意味ある if it's after this
[01:20.94] ゴマフアザラシに ask what's after death?
[01:23.15] 心の葛藤 it has to end
[01:24.55] でもさぁ案外その気持ちが gem
[01:26.70] Avant le voyage, tell me, what's the plan?
[01:28.50] 君と踊りたい Last Dance
[01:30.03] Kept walking on the wild side
[01:33.57] I don't wanna fall asleep throughout my life
[01:37.27] Sometimes in a buffalo style
[01:40.79] Sometimes like a rock 'n' roll mind
[01:43.94] Be wild side, try it
[01:44.74] Climax 夢見 all in
[01:46.47] オッズ見えない blurred
[01:48.25] 気持ち飛び立つ Boeing
[01:50.02] 一寸先はさぁ？
[01:54.51] It is wonderful my life
[01:56.74] Please could you kiss my name
[01:58.51] When the music's over?
[02:00.51] Turn off light, it was such a sweet time
[02:03.90] Could you pray for me, my friend?
[02:05.79] It's starting over time
[02:08.17] Taking overnight
[02:09.98] Taking over blue time
[02:12.02] If you heard that screaming, shout in your mind
[02:15.31] Taking over the shine
[02:17.13] Taking over the shooting star
[02:19.14] All I was talking about was music
[02:23.15] (And that's called jazz!)
