[00:19.44] Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.
[00:24.69] Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A.
[00:28.62] Plucked her eyebrows on the way
[00:30.95] Shaved her legs and then he was a she
[00:49.45] 
[00:33.59] She says, "Hey, babe
[00:34.65] Take a walk on the wild side"
[00:37.34] Said, "Hey, honey
[00:39.53] Take a walk on the wild side"
[00:54.03] 
[00:51.08] Candy came from out on the Island
[00:56.75] In the back room she was everybody's darling
[01:01.16] But she never lost her head
[01:03.87] Even when she was giving head
[01:18.37] 
[01:06.03] She says, "Hey, babe
[01:07.32] Take a walk on the wild side"
[01:09.71] Said, "Hey, babe
[01:12.25] Take a walk on the wild side"
[01:26.75] 
[01:14.16] And the colored girls go
[01:16.03] "Doo do doo do doo do do doo..."
[01:32.03] 
[01:43.62] Little Joe never once gave it away
[01:47.14] Everybody had to pay and pay
[01:50.71] A hustle here and a hustle there
[01:54.57] New York City's the place
[02:07.07] 
[01:56.92] Where they said, "Hey, babe
[01:58.23] Take a walk on the wild side"
[02:00.53] I said, "Hey, Joe
[02:03.19] Take a walk on the wild side"
[02:17.69] 
[02:15.66] Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
[02:18.69] Looking for soul food and a place to eat
[02:22.35] Went to the Apollo
[02:26.29] You should've seen them go, go, go
[02:43.29] 
[02:28.68] They said, "Hey, sugar
[02:30.28] Take a walk on the wild side"
[02:32.79] I said, "Hey, babe
[02:35.10] Take a walk on the wild side", alright
[02:39.23] Huh
[02:40.73] 
[02:47.67] Jackie is just speeding away
[02:51.17] Thought she was James Dean for a day
[02:56.36] Then I guess she had to crash
[02:58.72] Valium would have helped that bash
[03:15.72] 
[03:00.65] She said, "Hey, babe
[03:02.22] Take a walk on the wild side"
[03:04.97] I said, "Hey, honey
[03:06.31] Take a walk on the wild side"
[03:20.81] 
[03:07.95] And the colored girls say
[03:09.68] "Doo do doo do doo do do doo..."
