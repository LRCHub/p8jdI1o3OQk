Friday night and you feel it's coming
Your blood's pumping in your veins
A drink or two and the engine's running
Adrenaline erasing all the pain
You show your ticket and you're getting in now
You're running down to the barricades
First row, so you take it slow
You made it man, you've won the chase

Come on, take a ride on the wild side
Come on, take a ride on the storm
Come on, take a ride on the wild side
Till all your blues is gone

The storm is on and the lights went down
Shadowplay right on the stage
The band starts to shake thr ground
Fist high, you're falling in a rage
They're playing all your favorite trakcs now
You shout it out just right on top
Frustration's fading somehow
You go wild 'cause the band is hot

Come on, take a ride on the wild side
Come on, take a ride on the storm
Come on, take a ride on the wild side
Till all your blues is gone
