[00:26.13] Kneel down you sinners, to streetwise religion
[00:29.97] Greed's been crowned the new king
[00:34.15] Hollywood dream teens, yesterday's trash queens
[00:38.42] Save the blessing for the final ring, Amen
[00:59.42] 
[00:46.62] Take a ride on the wild side
[00:51.88] Wild side
[00:56.38] 
[00:58.09] I carry my crucifix under my death list
[01:02.20] Forward my mail to me in hell
[01:06.53] Liars and the martyrs, lost faith in the Father
[01:11.06] Long lost is the wishing well
[01:25.56] 
[01:17.46] Do you ride on the wild side?
[01:23.19] Wild side
[01:27.69] 
[01:32.02] Fallen angels, so fast to kill
[01:35.78] Thy kingdom come on the wild side
[01:40.08] Our Father, who ain't in Heaven
[01:44.26] Be Thy name on the wild side
[01:48.43] Holy Mary, Mother may I
[01:52.63] Pray for us on the wild side
[01:56.94] Wild side, wild side
[02:06.94] 
[02:30.07] Name dropping no names, glamorize cocaine
[02:33.96] Puppets with strings of gold
[02:38.09] East L.A. at midnight, papa won't be home tonight
[02:41.88] Found dead with his best friend's wife
[03:00.88] 
[02:48.63] Take a ride on the wild side
[02:54.66] Wild side
[02:59.60] Take a ride on the wild side
[03:04.97] Wild side
[03:09.47] 
[03:23.68] Can't fight, fatal strikes
[03:27.31] We lie on the wild side
[03:31.87] No escape, murder rape
[03:35.30] Doin' time on the wild side
[03:40.05] A baby cries, a cop dies
[03:43.94] A day's pay on the wild side
[03:48.35] Wild side, wild side
[03:52.47] Tragic life on the wild side
[03:56.67] Wild side, wild side
[04:00.74] Kickin' ass on the wild side
[04:07.07] No way back on the wild side
