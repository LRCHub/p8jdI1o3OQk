Mass に合わせた lifestyle 無理でも楽すりゃ不利
Freedom 謳歌 理不尽吹き飛ばす skill
これ違う last minute
Merci, au revoir
Pride は邪魔する猛者, Donc vas-y jete ca
全てTryし困憊, 笛に救われ Halftime
Climax 夢見 All in
オッズ見えない Blurred
気持ち飛び立つ Boeing
一寸先はさぁ?
Kept walking on the wild side
I don't wanna fall asleep throughout my life
Sometimes in a Clyde Barrow style
Sometimes like a james bond mind
be wild side.
try it.
Censor されるかも if i keep singing,
keep rapping,
keep telling the truth like Malcom X
死んでも意味ある if it's after this
ゴマフアザラシに ask whats after death?
心の葛藤 it has to end
でもさぁ案外その気持ちが gem
Avant le voyage tell me whats the plan
君と踊りたい Last Dance
Kept walking on the wild side
I don't wanna fall asleep throughout my life
Sometimes in a buffalo style
Sometimes like a rockn roll mind
be wild side.
try it.
Climax 夢見 All in
オッズ見えない Blurred
気持ち飛び立つ Boeing
一寸先はさぁ?
It is wonederful my life
Please could you kiss my name?
When the music is over.
Turn off light.
It was such a sweet time
Could you pray for me, my friend?
It's starting over time..
Taking over the night.
Taking over the blue time.
If you heard that screaming shout in your mind
Taking over the shine
Taking over the shootingstar
All I was talking about was music,
and that's called jazz!
